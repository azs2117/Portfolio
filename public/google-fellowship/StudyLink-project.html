        <!-- Product Overview -->
        <div class="project-section">
            <h2>Product Overview</h2>
            <p>StudyLink is a cloud-based application designed to help university students easily connect with study partners from their enrolled courses. By integrating with the Canvas API, StudyLink automates the retrieval of student enrollment data, allowing users to find classmates, manage study groups, and engage in collaborative learning. As part of this project, I contributed to the development of the User Microservice, which handled user authentication, profile management, and communication with Courseworks through API interactions.            </p>

        <!-- The Challenge -->
        <div class="project-section">
            <h2>The Challenge</h2>
            <p>Managing user data efficiently while ensuring security and seamless integration with Courseworks was a complex task. The system needed to handle authentication, profile updates, and enrollment tracking while maintaining performance at scale. Additionally, implementing HATEOAS links and ensuring consistent logging and correlation across distributed microservices added further complexity.            </p>
        </div>

        <!-- The Approach -->
        <div class="project-section">
            <h2>The Approach</h2>
            <p> To address these challenges, I implemented RESTful functionality within the User Microservice, ensuring clean and modular API endpoints for profile management. I introduced HATEOAS links to improve API discoverability and structured middleware logging with correlation IDs to track requests across services. Communication with Courseworks was facilitated through API integration, enabling real-time updates to user profiles and course enrollments. By adopting a CQRS (Command Query Responsibility Segregation) pattern, we optimized performance by separating read and write operations, improving system efficiency.</p>

        <!-- Results & Impact -->
        <div class="project-section">
            <h2>Results & Impact</h2>
            <p>The User Microservice successfully streamlined user authentication and profile management, reducing friction for students logging in and accessing their course-related data. Middleware logging and correlation IDs enhanced system observability, making it easier to diagnose issues and track requests across microservices. The integration with Courseworks improved real-time data consistency, ensuring that students always had up-to-date enrollment information. Through this experience, I gained valuable insights into designing scalable microservices, implementing API best practices, and leveraging structured logging to enhance system reliability.            </p>
