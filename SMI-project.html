        <!-- Product Overview -->
        <div class="project-section">
            <h2>Product Overview</h2>
            <p>The Subscription Management Interface (SMI) Redesign improved the way customers track, modify, and manage
                their subscriptions by shifting from a single-page list to a structured multi-page experience. The new
                design introduced a Subscription Management Page for an organized view of all subscriptions and a
                Subscription Detail Page with clear order status updates and enhanced modification options.
                By addressing long-standing usability frustrations, this redesign provided customers with greater
                control and clarity over their recurring orders.
            </p>
        </div>

        <!-- The Challenge -->
        <div class="project-section">
            <h2>The Challenge</h2>
            <p> The previous interface displayed all subscriptions in a single-page list, making it difficult for
                users to track shipments, modify orders, or understand their subscription status. Customers frequently
                contacted support due to unclear cancellation flows and limited product modification options. The
                redesign needed to improve organization and navigation while ensuring that users could easily update,
                track, and adjust their subscriptions with minimal confusion.</p>
        </div>

        <!-- The Approach -->
        <div class="project-section">
            <h2>The Approach</h2>
            <p> To create a more intuitive experience, I conducted competitive research on industry best practices and
                worked closely with developers to translate complex subscription logic into a multi-page system. The
                redesign introduced a structured Subscription Management Page with clear shipment details and a
                Subscription Detail Page with new modification features, such as swapping products and one-time removals.
                By designing flexible user flows for different order statuses—Upcoming, Processing, and In-Transit—we
                ensured that customers had the right options available at the right time.</p>

        <!-- Results & Impact -->
        <div class="project-section">
            <h2>Results & Impact</h2>
            <p>The redesigned interface significantly reduced customer support inquiries related to subscription
                management, as users could now clearly track and modify their orders. Enhanced organization and
                navigation led to increased customer confidence in managing their subscriptions, improving overall
                retention and satisfaction. Through this project, I learned the importance of early collaboration
                with developers to ensure feasibility and how structured design decisions can directly reduce friction
                in user interactions.</p>
