                  The Build Your Own Bundle experience gave customers complete control over their subscriptions, allowing them to curate personalized product selections instead of relying on pre-set bundles. Users could choose from Bonafide’s hero products, set their preferred order frequency, and unlock exclusive “buy more, save more” deals.

            <div class="project-section">
                <h2>The Challenge</h2>
                <p>
                    Pre-curated bundles didn’t always align with customers’ unique symptom needs, and existing competitor models primarily offered discounts for one-time purchases rather than subscriptions. The challenge was to design an intuitive interface that allowed users to select multiple products, choose different subscription plans, and clearly see their savings—all while managing the complexities of recurring orders with varying shipment frequencies.
                </p>
            </div>

            <!-- The Approach -->
            <div class="project-section">
                <h2>The Approach</h2>
                <p>
                    I conducted a competitive analysis to identify best practices for bundle customization and iterated on 12 design versions to refine product selection layouts, subscription dropdowns, and savings visualization. To ensure seamless integration, I collaborated closely with third-party developers, balancing design ambitions with technical feasibility. By leveraging existing product tiles and dynamically calculating savings within the mini-cart, we streamlined development while improving the user experience. Orders with mixed subscription plans were automatically split to match their frequency cycles, simplifying management for both customers and internal teams.

                <p>
                    The Build Your Own Bundle experience introduced a flexible, value-driven subscription model that empowered customers to personalize their orders while increasing average order value through bulk savings incentives. Improved clarity in product selection and pricing transparency reduced friction in the checkout process, leading to higher subscription conversions. Through this project, I gained key insights into aligning design with technical feasibility, reinforcing the importance of early developer collaboration to create scalable, user-friendly solutions.
