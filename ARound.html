        <!-- The Challenge -->
        <div class="project-section">
          <h2>The Challenge</h2>
          <p>
            Global travel remains inaccessible to many due to financial, health, political, and logistical barriers. Whether seeking to reconnect with family or explore cultural landmarks, people are often limited in their ability to experience the world firsthand. Traditional social platforms also fall short in offering meaningful cultural connection, instead emphasizing curated photos over immersive, informative content.
          </p>

        <!-- The Solution -->
        <div class="project-section">
          <h2>The Solution</h2>
          <p>
            ARound provides a virtual window into the world. It combines augmented reality, AI-generated educational overlays, and social interaction to let users discover, share, and explore cultural content from anywhere. Unlike static virtual tourism platforms, ARound turns every post into an immersive learning experience—fueled by community-driven storytelling and interactive exploration.

          <p>
            ARound is currently in early design and prototype development. The next phase involves refining educational overlays, implementing AR-based post creation in Swift, and preparing for user testing. The long-term goal is to empower global cultural discovery—without the barriers of borders or budgets—by providing an inclusive, immersive, and shareable travel alternative.
